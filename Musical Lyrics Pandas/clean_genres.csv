Slim Shady youre on Just a feeling Ive got like somethings about to happen but I dont know what If that means what I think it means were in trouble  big trouble And if he is as bananas as you say Im not taking any chances You are just what the doc ordered  Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox slapbox They said I rap like a robot so call me Rapbot  But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My penll go off when I halfcock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit  Made a living and a killing off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack Im an MC still as honest  But as rude and indecent as all hell Syllables skillaholic Kill em all with This slicketygippetyhippityhiphop You dont really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappityrap Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac backpack rap yapyap yackettyyack  And now at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicing that Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half  Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow All I do is drop Fbombs feel my wrath of attack Rappers are having a rough time period heres a maxipad Its actually disastrously bad for the wack While Im masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah  Cause Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox slapbox Let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard  Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got Well to be truthful the blueprints simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the earth like an asteroid I did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew  MCs get taken to school with this music Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme Now I lead a new school full of students Me Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz 2Pac N WA Cube hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim  Inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position To meet RunDMC and induct them into the motherfuckin Rock n Roll Hall of Fame Even though Ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You fags think its all a game till I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinking Little gay looking boy  So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy You witnessing a massacre Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy Oy vey that boys gay thats all they say looking boy You get a thumbs up pat on the back And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy Hey looking boy what you say looking boy I get a hell yeah from Dre looking boy Imma work for everything I have Never asked nobody for shit get out my face looking boy Basically boy youre never gonna be capable Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy  Cause Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod The way Im racing around the track call me Nascar Nascar Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod this planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard  So you be Thor and Ill be Odin you rodent Im omnipotent Let off then Im reloading immediately with these bombs Im totin And I should not be woken Im the walking dead but Im just a talking head a zombie floating But I got your mom deep throating  Im out my Ramen noodle we have nothing in common poodle Im a Doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil Its me my honestys brutal But its honestly futile if I dont utilize what I do though  For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground but I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind  So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come trying to censor you Like that one line I said on Im Back from The Mathers LP One where I tried to say Id take seven kids from Columbine Put em all in a line add an AK47 a revolver and a nine See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was but Im  Morphin into an immortal coming through the portal Youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows You write normal fuck being normal And I just bought a new raygun from the future  To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhethers pad Singin to a man while he played piano Man oh man that was the 247 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day Hey Fab Imma kill you Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed JJ Fad  Uh sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming Im a human What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman Innovative and Im made of rubber So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and itll glue to you Im devastating more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music you make elevator music Oh hes too mainstream Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it Its not hiphop its pop cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it  I dont know how to make songs like that I dont know what words to use Let me know when it occurs to you While Im ripping any one of these verses diverse as you Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you How many verses I gotta murder to prove That if you were half as nice your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too  School flunky pill junky But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself but still hungry I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to And Im a million leagues above you ill when I speak in tongues But its still tongue and cheek fuck you Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel Im asleep in the front seat Bumping Heavy D amp The Boyz still chunky but funky But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me  They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation Understand the discrimination  But fuck it lifes handing you lemons make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then Dont mistake it for Satan Its a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas And take a vacation to trip a broad And make her fall on her face and dont be a retard Be a king Think not Why be a king when you can be a God,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
